                    The AI assistant can take three types of input: Text, audio or video, and give you a response in several ways, through text on screen or voice in ear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AI assistant digests your input and suggests a meaning and a solution: Either an answer or a follow-up question.
                </p>

                <h3>Text interface</h3>
                <p>
                    Give input by writing what you see or hear or cut and paste what you receive in the AI assistant.
                    The AI assistant gives textual output by writing the suggestions to your laptop, tablet or smartphone screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may use the text output in at least three ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By reading it to the person you are speaking with
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By letting the person read it on your screen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By cutting and pasting it to an ongoing chat or email
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <img alt="Image showing two women, one cooking while using earbuds" src="../pictures/audio-interface-square.jpg">
                <h3>Audio interface</h3>
                <p>
                    Repeat what you see or hear or let the AI assistant listen in on your conversation through the microphone of your device. The AI assistant reads reply suggestions to you to help you engage in conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may use the audio output in at least two ways:   
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By repeating what you hear in your headset/earpods to the person you are speaking with
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By letting the AI-assistant respond for you through an audio channel with a synthesized voice
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can have both text and audio output at the same time, and have the suggested response repeated in one of the output modes.
                </p>

                <h3>Video interface</h3>
                <p>
                    Take pictures or video of a situation with your camera. Our AI assistant will help you give suggestions on how to interpret gestures and facial expressions, and highlight them on the screen next to the face you are observing.

                <h3>Privacy</h3>
                <p>
                    The information that the AI assistant receives and processes, and the following interpretations and suggestions may be felt as very personal by you and an invasion of the privacy of the person you communicate with. The exchange with the AI assistant is therefore end to end encrypted. No personal data is included in the exchange with the AI assistant, as it gets anonymized before storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The input received is only processed by the AI assistant and can not be seen, heard or copied by any person other than you and the person you choose to expose it to during your use of the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, privacy is protected, while the AI assistant gets better and better through learning from input from you and all other users without knowing who it comes from.
                </p>

                    <b>Warning:</b> When using video interface mode, this should still be done only with the consent of the other persons involved.
