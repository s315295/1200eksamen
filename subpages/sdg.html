                <h3>What is neurodivergence?</h3>
                <p>Some people have brains that function differently from the average person, also known as the neurotypicals. Not “better” or “worse” but differently.</p>
                <p>The neurodivergent may or may not have a diagnosis, like for example autism, ADHD or dyslexia. These diagnoses are generally not apparent to other people and do not tell other people very much about what the practical barriers to equal opportunities are. The range of differences between one person with ADHD and the next one may be at least as great as between two so-called neurotypicals.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>How can the AI assistant help?</h3>
                <p>One of the problems that a neurodivergent person may encounter is the understanding of everyday communication between people. </p>
                <p>By helping with understanding of what other people say or write and how to respond to it, our AI assistant may lower the communication barrier. In this way, the neurodivergent may integrate better with other people. This may reduce or eliminate one limiting factor to the realization of their potential in society.</p>

                <h3>Availability and affordability</h3>
                <p>Our AI assistant cannot help every person in every place. It requires a PC, pad or smartphone and network access to work. But these are implements and systems that are increasingly available to more and more people. </p>
                <p>By being frugal in the system and network requirements of the AI assistant and making it available as free software, it will be able to help more and more people in more and more places.</p>

                <h3>SDG 10 - Reduced inequalities</h3>
                <blockquote cite="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10"><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10">"Reduce inequalities within and among countries"</a></blockquote>
                <p>This SDG addresses equal opportunity directly. Target 10-3 expands on this:</p> 
                <blockquote cite="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10">“Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard.”</blockquote>
                <p>The AI assistant is a small contribution to try to help reduce inequality in the world by helping with social relations.</p>

                <h3>SDG 4 - Quality education</h3>
                <blockquote cite="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4"><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4">"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"</a></blockquote>
                <p>This SDG features inclusion and equitability. Target 4.5 details this:</p> 
                <blockquote>“By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations.”</blockquote>
                <p>Inclusion and equitability in education and training also require social inclusion. Neurodivergence may be an invisible “disability” that leaves both children, adolescents and adults in a vulnerable social situation.</p>
                <p>Our AI assistant may contribute to leveling the playing field in the schoolyard and other social situations. It may also be a contribution to lifelong learning about how we express ourselves.</p>

                <h3>SDG 8 - Decent work and economic growth</h3>
                <blockquote><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8">"Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all"</a></blockquote>
                <p>This SDG focuses on employment and decent work. Target 8.5 says:</p>
                <blockquote>"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value"</blockquote>
                <p>Again, communication problems may be a barrier and thus an invisible “disability” both to get a job and to function in a job.</p>
                <p>Our AI assistant may pave the way for greater inclusion, to the benefit of all.</p>

                <h3>SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities</h3>
                <blockquote><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11">"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”</a></blockquote>
                <p>On the surface, this SDG focuses on the “hardware” of communities, but target 11.2 shows one important part of the “hardware” that must function for the “software”, that is people:</p>
                <blockquote>“By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons"</blockquote>
                <p>Signs, public announcements, directions for use, etc. may be difficult for any person to interpret and be a barrier to mobility.</p>
                <p>Our AI assistant may help detangle such information.</p>
