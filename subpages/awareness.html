                <h2>What are the hard questions?</h2>
                <p>
                    In everyday language there are many questions that are wide open to interpretation and expressions that do not mean what the words seem to say. Many have learned to “translate” and react to such questions and expressions. For others, such as with neurodiverse people,  these are the hardest parts of communication: Questions with an overwhelming number of possible interpretations or expressions that are nearly meaningless at face value or absolutely not to be taken literally leaves you stuck and lost, trying to come up with a useful response.

                <h3>Phrases</h3>
                <p>Phrases are set expressions that are used for example to start, link together or end a social encounter.</p>
                <p>The classical example is the phrase “How are you?” It may seem to invite an answer giving details of your physical and mental wellbeing, but most often the anticipated answer is “Fine! And you?” before going on to other things. But said with an intonation of concern by a near friend who has understood that you are not at all at your best today (or a snoopy neighbour who has heard that you are not well), the expected answer may be different.</p>
                <p>Some phrases are just superfluous words, not adding anything to the meaning, for example “, you know”.</p>

                <h3>Dialects, sociolects, slang and technical language</h3>
                <p>A dialect is a language as spoken by people from a certain region or social group.</p>
                <p>A sociolect is a language as used by a certain class of people.</p>
                <p>Slang is informal language used in a particular context or group of people.</p>
                <p>Technical language is language with a lot of technical terms or common words used with a specific technical meaning.</p>
                <p>The common characteristic of all these is that everyday objects and doings may be described using special words or versions of words and that common words may be used to carry uncommon meanings or connotations. For example, “weed” conveys different meanings to a gardener and law enforcement.</p>

                <h3>Fuzzy thinking, speaking, and writing</h3>
                <p>
                    Use of wrong words, bad grammar, wrong sentence structure, missing logic and incoherent speech may require a lot of untangling to arrive at a useful meaning.

                <h3>How can the AI assistant help?</h3>
                    <p>Not all verbal or written tangles can be untangled, but the AI assistant may reduce uncertainty about the meaning by</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Suggesting what the meaning is or may be</li>
                        <li>Suggesting possible answers or questions to make the meaning clearer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The AI assistant can do this because it has been trained through being fed thousands of everyday exchanges of words, expressions, sentences, questions and answers, and the accompanying intonation, facial expressions and other body language where available. The AI assistant compares your input with stored input and comes up with suggestions for your response.</p>
