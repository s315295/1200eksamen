                    Creator of the site
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Trygve Fjeld Halvorsen - s315295
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was mentored by Ulrik Bakken Singsaas - s351917. I was influenced by him and his style of web design, but all code and text was written and created by me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The creator of the site developed the proposed solution with inherent diversity regarding the topic. Trygve has Aspergers and is familiar with the problems that this solution tries to solve.
                    Trygve’s mentor Ulrik is also neuro diverse having an ADHD diagnosis, so we sat with unique and relevant perspectives on the topic as the solution was developed.

                <p>
                    Out of concern for the accessibility and backwards compatibility of the site, we decided to keep the site low tech and simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was developed mobile-first, uses no Javascript, and has been tested to retain full functionality all the way back to Internet Explorer 11. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It uses only Flexbox for responsiveness as this is a tried and true CSS technology and we used this extensively to avoid media queries to make the site respond in a predictable way for users who wish to use the site on different devices.
